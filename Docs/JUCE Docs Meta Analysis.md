Here is a master architectural document compiled from your project brief (`claude.md`) and the three JUCE best-practice guides.

This guide synthesizes all findings, resolves the minor tensions between the documents, and provides a single, unified architectural plan specifically for your **F9 Batch Resampler** port.

The analysis confirms that your plan in `claude.md` is overwhelmingly aligned with modern JUCE best practices. The general-purpose guides provide valuable refinements, which are integrated below.

## **Master Architectural Guide: F9 Batch Resampler (JUCE/C++ Port)**

This document outlines the definitive architecture for porting your Swift application to a cross-platform JUCE/C++ application. It combines the specific project goals from `claude.md` with the consensus best practices from the provided expert guides.

### 1. Core Architecture: The Foundation

There is a strong consensus across all documents on the core application structure.

* **Foundation Class:** Your `MainComponent` **must** inherit from `juce::AudioAppComponent`. This is the correct foundation for a standalone audio app as it provides the built-in `deviceManager` for all I/O.
* **State Machine:** Your plan to use `MainComponent` to host the central state machine (driven by `appState` flags like `isProcessing`, `isMeasuringLatency`, etc.) is the correct and most straightforward approach.
* **Audio Callback:** The `getNextAudioBlock()` method should be kept minimal. Your plan to use it as a "dispatcher" (a simple `if/else if` block that checks the `appState` flags) is the perfect, real-time-safe design.

**Refinement (Architecture Separation):**
Your `claude.md` plan places all service logic (latency measurement, sine generation, processing) directly inside `MainComponent`. This is a perfectly valid and direct way to port your Swift services.

However, the `Perplexity` and `Gemini` guides suggest a "separation of concerns" for long-term maintainability.

* **Recommendation:** For the initial port, implementing all logic within `MainComponent` (as you planned) is the fastest path.
* **Long-Term Best Practice:** Consider refactoring the logic from your Swift `Services` into distinct C++ classes (e.g., `LatencyMeasurer`, `HardwareLoopTester`, `FileProcessor`). `MainComponent` would then *own* instances of these classes and simply call them (e.g., `latencyMeasurer->process(bufferToFill)`), keeping `MainComponent` itself clean.

### 2. State Management: The "Source of Truth"

This was a point of minor divergence, but the conclusion for your project is clear.

* **Tension:** The `Gemini` guide advocated for `juce::ValueTree` as the central state, while the other guides (and your `claude.md` plan) use a simple `AppState` struct.
* **Resolution:** The `juce::ValueTree` is a powerful tool, especially for complex UI binding and automatic state persistence (saving/loading). However, for your project, it is an unnecessary complication.
* **Definitive Recommendation:** **Stick with your `AppState.h` plan.** A central `AppState` struct (as described in `claude.md`, `Perplexity`, and `GPT`) is the correct, simplest, and most direct way to port your Swift `MainViewModel` and `ProcessingSettings`. It is clean, efficient, and perfectly suited for this application.

### 3. The "Golden Rules" of Real-Time Audio

All four documents are in **100% agreement** on this, the most critical aspect of audio development. The `getNextAudioBlock()` method runs on a high-priority, real-time thread and **must never** be blocked.

**Forbidden in `getNextAudioBlock()`:**
* **No Locks:** No `std::mutex`, `juce::CriticalSection`, or other blocking locks.
* **No Memory Allocation:** No `new`, `delete`, `std::vector::push_back`, or `juce::String` operations. All buffers (like `recordingBuffer`) must be pre-allocated in `prepareToPlay()`.
* **No File I/O:** No reading or writing to disk.
* **No OS/UI Calls:** Do not interact with the UI, post messages, or call any system API that could block.

Your `claude.md` plan already respects these rules by delegating all heavy work to the `timerCallback`.

### 4. Thread Communication (The "Nervous System")

This is the second most critical area, and all guides are in strong agreement, validating your plan.

#### **Audio Thread → Message (UI) Thread**
This is for tasks like saving a file *after* processing or updating the UI.

* **Consensus Pattern:** The **`std::atomic` flag + `juce::Timer`** pattern is the correct, safest, and most recommended approach.
    1.  `MainComponent` (audio thread) finishes a task.
    2.  It sets a non-blocking flag (e.g., `std::atomic<bool> shouldSaveFile { false };`).
    3.  The `timerCallback()` (running on the message thread) polls for this flag.
    4.  When `true`, the timer performs the heavy work (like saving the file) and resets the flag.
* **CRITICAL WARNING:** All three best-practice guides (`Perplexity`, `Gemini`, `GPT`) **unanimously warn against using `juce::AsyncUpdater` from the audio thread.** They state it can lock or allocate, causing audio glitches. **Do not use it from `getNextAudioBlock()`.**

#### **Message (UI) Thread → Audio Thread**
This is for tasks like starting or stopping processing.

* **Consensus Pattern:** This is simple and safe. Your UI components (on the message thread) can directly:
    1.  Call functions on `MainComponent` (e.g., `startProcessing()`).
    2.  This function then sets the `std::atomic` flags (e.g., `appState.isProcessing = true;`) that `getNextAudioBlock()` reads.
    3.  This is perfectly thread-safe, as the audio thread only *reads* these flags.

### 5. File I/O (The "Non-Blocking" Workflow)

This is a key part of your app, and your `claude.md` plan is the correct one for *batch processing*.

#### **File Reading (Loading Source Files)**
* **Consensus:** File reading must happen on the message thread, *before* audio processing begins.
* **Your Workflow (Correct):**
    1.  User clicks "Start Processing."
    2.  `MainComponent::startProcessing()` (on the message thread) loads the *first* audio file into `appState.currentPlaybackBuffer` using `juce::AudioFormatManager` and an `AudioFormatReader`.
    3.  *Then*, it sets `appState.isProcessing = true`, which starts the audio thread.

#### **File Writing (Saving Processed Files)**
This was a minor point of tension, but the resolution is clear for your use case.

* **Tension:** The `Gemini` guide recommended `juce::AudioFormatWriter::ThreadedWriter`, while your `claude.md` plan uses the `Timer` callback.
* **Resolution:** `ThreadedWriter` is designed for *streaming* continuous audio to a file (like recording in a DAW). Your app does not do this. It records an *entire* file into memory (`appState.recordingBuffer`) and *then* saves it.
* **Definitive Recommendation:** Your `claude.md` plan (which matches the `Perplexity` and `GPT` guides) is **the correct pattern for this project.**
    1.  `getNextAudioBlock()` (audio thread) finishes recording to `appState.recordingBuffer`.
    2.  It sets `appState.isProcessing = false` and `std::atomic<bool> shouldSaveFile = true`.
    3.  `timerCallback()` (message thread) sees the flag.
    4.  It calls `saveProcessedFile(appState.recordingBuffer)` (using `juce::AudioFormatWriter` and the JUCE 8 `Options` struct). This is safe because it's on the message thread.
    5.  After saving, it loads the *next* file and re-sets `appState.isProcessing = true` to continue the batch.

### 6. Multichannel Device Management

Your `claude.md` file was light on this, but the `GPT` and `Perplexity` guides provide the necessary best practices.

* **Device Manager:** Use the inherited `AudioAppComponent::deviceManager`.
* **Enumerating Channels:** To support multichannel interfaces (like RME, etc.), you must allow the `deviceManager` to see all available channels. A common practice is to initialize with a high channel count, e.g., `setAudioChannels(0, 256);`.
* **Selecting Channels:** The user needs to select which stereo pair to use.
    1.  Your UI (e.g., `AudioOutputPicker`) should query the `deviceManager` for the active device's channel names (`device->getOutputChannelNames()`).
    2.  When the user selects a logical pair (e.g., "Output 3-4"), your code must translate this into the correct settings.
    3.  Get the current `AudioDeviceSetup`: `deviceManager.getAudioDeviceSetup(setup);`
    4.  Configure the *active* channels using the `juce::BigInteger` bitmasks:
        ```cpp
        // User selected channels 3-4 (indices 2 and 3)
        setup.outputChannels.clear();
        setup.outputChannels.setBit(2);
        setup.outputChannels.setBit(3);
        
        setup.inputChannels.clear();
        setup.inputChannels.setBit(2);
        setup.inputChannels.setBit(3);
        ```
    5.  Apply the changes: `deviceManager.setAudioDeviceSetup(setup, true);`
    6.  This re-initializes the audio device. `prepareToPlay()` will be called, and `getNextAudioBlock()` will now receive a buffer that corresponds to *only* the selected physical channels.

### 7. Critical Logic (from `claude.md`)

The core "magic" of your app must be preserved.

* **`trimLatency()`:** This logic is critical. The JUCE C++ implementation in `claude.md` is correct. It's just `AudioBuffer` manipulation and is perfectly safe.
* **`isReverbTailBelowNoiseFloor()`:** This RMS calculation is also correct. Your plan to call this from `getNextAudioBlock()` is acceptable *as long as it is fast*. Since it's just math on a small window (e.g., 2048 samples) and not a blocking operation, it is considered real-time-safe.
