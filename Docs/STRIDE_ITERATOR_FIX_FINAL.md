# StrideIterator C++20 Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
JUCE 8.0.10's `StrideIterator` is missing C++20 iterator traits, causing compilation errors on macOS 14.2 SDK.

## Solution
Patch the system JUCE installation to add the required iterator traits.

### Apply the Fix

Run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/jameswiltshire/Developer/f9_juce-batch-reasmpler/f9_juce_batch_resampler
chmod +x patch-juce-iterator.sh
sudo ./patch-juce-iterator.sh
```

This will:
1. Backup the original file to `/Applications/JUCE/modules/juce_audio_devices/native/juce_CoreAudio_mac.cpp.backup-YYYYMMDD`
2. Add C++20 iterator traits to the `StrideIterator` struct

### What Gets Added

The patch adds these typedefs inside the `StrideIterator` struct (line ~1064):

```cpp
// C++20 iterator traits - required for compatibility with modern standard library
using iterator_category = std::random_access_iterator_tag;
using value_type        = typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type;
using difference_type   = std::ptrdiff_t;
using pointer           = Iterator;
using reference         = typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::reference;
```

### Why This is Safe

- The patch only affects JUCE 8.0.10
- A backup is created automatically
- The change is forwards-compatible with newer JUCE versions
- No project files are modified

### After Patching

Clean and rebuild:
```bash
cd Builds/MacOSX
rm -rf build
xcodebuild -project NewProject.xcodeproj -configuration Debug -target "NewProject - App"
```

### Alternative

If you can't modify system files, update to JUCE 8.0.12+ which has this fix built-in.

**Note**: This issue doesn't appear on all systems. If it worked at home, that machine likely has:
- A newer JUCE version
- Different Xcode/SDK version
- Different C++ standard library implementation
