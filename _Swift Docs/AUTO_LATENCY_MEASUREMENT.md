# Automatic Latency Measurement

## Date: 2025-10-19

---

## Overview

F9-Batch-Resampler now **automatically measures latency** before processing if needed. You never have to worry about processing files with incorrect latency compensation - the app ensures latency is always measured and up-to-date.

---

## How It Works

### Automatic Measurement Triggers

The app will **automatically measure latency** before processing in these scenarios:

1. **First Use** - No latency measurement exists yet
2. **Buffer Size Changed** - You changed buffer size since last measurement
3. **Manual Processing** - You click "Process All" without having measured

### The Process

When you click **"Process All"**:

1. App checks if latency measurement is needed
2. If needed, shows message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Latency measurement required before processing"
3. Automatically runs: "üîÑ Auto-measuring latency..."
4. Measures round-trip latency through your hardware loop
5. On success: Proceeds immediately to processing
6. On failure: Cancels processing with error message

**You don't need to do anything** - it's completely automatic!

---

## UI Indicators

### File Drop View

**When latency hasn't been measured yet**:
```
[Process All] (enabled - ready to auto-measure)
‚ÑπÔ∏è Latency will be measured automatically before processing
```

**When buffer size changed since last measurement**:
```
[Process All] (enabled - ready to re-measure)
‚ÑπÔ∏è Buffer size changed - latency will be re-measured before processing
```

**When latency is current and valid**:
```
[Process All] (enabled - ready to process)
(no warning message)
```

**When destination folder not selected**:
```
[Process All] (disabled/grayed)
‚ö†Ô∏è Select a destination folder in Settings to begin processing
```

### Console Log Example

**Auto-measurement before processing**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Latency measurement required before processing
üîÑ Auto-measuring latency...
üîÑ Measuring latency and noise floor...
   Output: Babyface Pro (25+26)
   Input: Babyface Pro (1+2)
   Buffer: 256 samples
‚úÖ Latency measured: 1024 samples (23.22 ms @ 44.1kHz)
   Noise floor: -96.5 dB
üé¨ Starting batch processing of 15 file(s)
```

---

## Manual Measurement Still Available

You can still measure latency manually in **Settings** if you want to:

1. Verify your hardware loop is connected correctly
2. Check latency after changing buffer size
3. Re-measure if you suspect incorrect values

**Settings Tab ‚Üí Audio Interface Settings ‚Üí "Measure Latency" button**

---

## Safety Features

### Requirements Before Auto-Measurement

The auto-measurement **requires**:
- ‚úÖ Input stereo pair selected
- ‚úÖ Output stereo pair selected
- ‚úÖ Hardware loop cable connected (output ‚Üí input)

If these aren't met, measurement will fail and processing will be cancelled with a clear error message.

### Measurement Validation

After auto-measurement, the app verifies:
- Measurement succeeded (latency value captured)
- Peak detected in captured audio
- Noise floor measured

If validation fails:
- Processing is **cancelled**
- Error logged: "‚ùå Processing cancelled: Latency measurement failed"
- You can check Settings to see what went wrong

### Buffer Size Change Detection

The app tracks which buffer size was used for measurement via `lastBufferSizeWhenMeasured`:

```swift
// After successful measurement
settings.measuredLatencySamples = 1024
settings.lastBufferSizeWhenMeasured = .samples256  // Current buffer size

// Later, if user changes buffer size to 512
settings.bufferSize = .samples512

// App detects mismatch
settings.needsLatencyRemeasurement == true  // Auto-measure on next process
```

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

#### [MainViewModel.swift](F9-Batch-Resampler/ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift)

**processAllFiles()** (lines 194-206):
```swift
// Auto-measure latency if not measured or if buffer size changed
if settings.measuredLatencySamples == nil || settings.needsLatencyRemeasurement {
    appendLog("‚ö†Ô∏è Latency measurement required before processing")
    appendLog("üîÑ Auto-measuring latency...")

    await measureLatency()

    // Check if measurement succeeded
    guard settings.measuredLatencySamples != nil else {
        appendLog("‚ùå Processing cancelled: Latency measurement failed")
        return
    }
}

isProcessing = true
appendLog("üé¨ Starting batch processing of \(filesToProcess.count) file(s)")
```

**Key Points**:
- Checks `settings.measuredLatencySamples == nil` (no measurement)
- Checks `settings.needsLatencyRemeasurement` (buffer size changed)
- Calls existing `measureLatency()` function
- Validates measurement succeeded before proceeding
- Logs each step clearly for user visibility

#### [FileDropView.swift](F9-Batch-Resampler/Views/FileDropView.swift)

**Button State** (line 111):
```swift
// BEFORE (disabled when latency not measured):
.disabled(vm.isProcessing || vm.isPreviewing || vm.files.isEmpty ||
          vm.settings.measuredLatencySamples == nil || vm.settings.outputFolderPath == nil)

// AFTER (removed latency check - will auto-measure):
.disabled(vm.isProcessing || vm.isPreviewing || vm.files.isEmpty ||
          vm.settings.outputFolderPath == nil)
```

**Hint Messages** (lines 115-134):
```swift
// Show helpful hints based on what's missing
if !vm.files.isEmpty {
    if vm.settings.outputFolderPath == nil {
        HStack {
            Image(systemName: "info.circle").foregroundStyle(.orange)
            Text("Select a destination folder in Settings to begin processing")
        }
    } else if vm.settings.measuredLatencySamples == nil || vm.settings.needsLatencyRemeasurement {
        HStack {
            Image(systemName: "info.circle").foregroundStyle(.blue)
            Text(vm.settings.measuredLatencySamples == nil ?
                "Latency will be measured automatically before processing" :
                "Buffer size changed - latency will be re-measured before processing")
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- User knows what will happen
- Blue color indicates informational (not a blocker)
- Different messages for first measurement vs. re-measurement

#### [ProcessingSettings.swift](F9-Batch-Resampler/Models/ProcessingSettings.swift)

**needsLatencyRemeasurement** (lines 56-61):
```swift
var needsLatencyRemeasurement: Bool {
    guard let lastMeasured = lastBufferSizeWhenMeasured else {
        return measuredLatencySamples != nil  // If we have a measurement but no record of buffer size, remeasure
    }
    return lastMeasured != bufferSize
}
```

This computed property:
- Returns `true` when current buffer size ‚â† buffer size used for measurement
- Triggers auto-measurement before processing
- Ensures latency values are always accurate for current settings

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: First Time Processing

```
1. User drops audio files
2. User selects destination folder
3. User clicks "Process All"

   ‚Üí ‚ÑπÔ∏è "Latency will be measured automatically before processing"

4. App shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Latency measurement required before processing"
5. App shows: "üîÑ Auto-measuring latency..."
6. Measurement completes (2-3 seconds)
7. App shows: "‚úÖ Latency measured: 1024 samples (23.22 ms @ 44.1kHz)"
8. Processing begins immediately: "üé¨ Starting batch processing of 15 file(s)"
9. Files processed with correct latency compensation
```

**Total extra time**: ~2-3 seconds for automatic measurement

### Scenario 2: Buffer Size Changed

```
1. User has previously measured latency at 256 samples buffer
2. User changes buffer size to 512 samples in Settings

   ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Settings shows "Buffer size changed - please re-measure"

3. User drops files and clicks "Process All"

   ‚Üí ‚ÑπÔ∏è "Buffer size changed - latency will be re-measured before processing"

4. App auto-measures with new buffer size
5. Processing begins with updated latency values
```

### Scenario 3: Latency Already Measured

```
1. User has valid latency measurement
2. Buffer size hasn't changed
3. User clicks "Process All"

   ‚Üí No auto-measurement
   ‚Üí Processing begins immediately

4. App shows: "üé¨ Starting batch processing of 15 file(s)"
5. No delay, no extra steps
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### Hardware Loop Not Connected

If you click "Process All" without hardware loop connected:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Latency measurement required before processing
üîÑ Auto-measuring latency...
‚ùå Latency measurement failed: No peak detected in captured audio
‚ùå Processing cancelled: Latency measurement failed
```

**Solution**: Connect hardware loop cable and try again

### Input/Output Not Selected

If devices aren't configured:

```
‚ùå Cannot measure latency: No input/output selected
‚ùå Processing cancelled: Latency measurement failed
```

**Solution**: Select input/output pairs in Device Selection

### Measurement Timeout

If measurement hangs (rare):

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Latency measurement required before processing
üîÑ Auto-measuring latency...
‚ùå Latency measurement failed: Timeout waiting for audio capture
‚ùå Processing cancelled: Latency measurement failed
```

**Solution**: Check audio interface connection, try manual measurement
