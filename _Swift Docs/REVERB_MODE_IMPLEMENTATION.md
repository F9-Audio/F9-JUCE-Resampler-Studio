# Reverb Mode Implementation

## Date: 2025-10-19

## Overview

Reverb Mode is an intelligent recording feature that automatically detects when a reverb tail has fallen below your hardware's noise floor and stops recording. This is perfect for capturing long reverb tails without wasting time or memory on recording silence.

---

## How It Works

### Standard Mode (Default)
- Records for a **fixed length**: `source + latency + (latency × 4)` safety buffer
- Always captures the same amount regardless of reverb tail length
- Fast and predictable for drum samples without reverb

### Reverb Mode (Toggle On)
- Records **minimum length**: `source + latency`
- Then **monitors** audio in 100ms windows
- Stops when reverb tail falls below **noise floor + margin**
- Captures exactly what you need, no more, no less

---

## Technical Details

### Reverb Tail Detection Algorithm

**Step 1: Minimum Recording**
```swift
let minimumSamples = (frameCount + latencyFrames) * inputChannelCount
// Wait for source file + latency to finish playing
```

**Step 2: Tail Monitoring**
```swift
let checkWindowSamples = Int(ProcessingSettings.sampleRate * 0.1) * inputChannelCount
// Analyze 100ms windows at 44.1kHz = 4,410 frames
```

**Step 3: Silence Detection**
```swift
consecutiveSilentChecks = 0
requiredSilentChecks = 3  // Need 300ms of silence to stop

while consecutiveSilentChecks < requiredSilentChecks {
    wait 50ms
    if isReverbTailBelowNoiseFloor(last 100ms) {
        consecutiveSilentChecks++
    } else {
        consecutiveSilentChecks = 0  // Reset if sound detected
    }
}
```

### Noise Floor Threshold Calculation

**Formula**:
```swift
thresholdDb = measuredNoiseFloorDb + (measuredNoiseFloorDb × marginPercent / 100)
```

**Example** (noise floor = -96 dB, margin = 10%):
```
thresholdDb = -96 + (-96 × 0.10)
            = -96 + (-9.6)
            = -105.6 dB
```

The reverb tail must stay below -105.6 dB for 300ms to trigger stop.

### Safety Features

1. **60 Second Maximum**
   - Prevents infinite recording if reverb never decays
   - Throws error: "Reverb mode exceeded 60 second maximum"

2. **Fallback Threshold**
   - If noise floor not measured: uses -80 dB threshold
   - Ensures reverb mode works even without measurement

3. **Consecutive Window Requirement**
   - Needs 3 consecutive silent windows (300ms total)
   - Prevents false positives from brief quiet moments
   - Ensures reverb tail is truly finished

## User Interface

### Enabling Reverb Mode

**Settings Tab → Processing Settings**:
```
☑ Reverb Mode (stop on noise floor)
```

When enabled, shows:
```
Noise floor margin: 10%
━━━━━━━━━━━━ [slider 0-50%]

Measured noise floor: -96.5 dB
```

### Auto-Measurement

**When you enable reverb mode**:
- If noise floor **not measured** → Auto-triggers latency measurement
- Measurement includes both latency + noise floor
- Only happens if measurement missing

**Warning shown**:
```
⚠️ Noise floor will be measured automatically when processing
```

### [AudioProcessingService.swift](F9-Batch-Resampler/Services/AudioProcessingService.swift)

**Lines 221-259** (Recording Loop):
```swift
if settings.useReverbMode {
    // Reverb mode: Stop when tail falls below noise floor
    let minimumSamples = (frameCount + latencyFrames) * inputChannelCount
    while capturedAudio.count < minimumSamples {
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 10_000_000)
    }

    // Monitor for silence
    let checkWindowSamples = Int(ProcessingSettings.sampleRate * 0.1) * inputChannelCount
    var consecutiveSilentChecks = 0
    let requiredSilentChecks = 3

    while consecutiveSilentChecks < requiredSilentChecks {
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 50_000_000)

        if capturedAudio.count >= checkWindowSamples {
            let recentAudio = Array(capturedAudio.suffix(checkWindowSamples))
            if isReverbTailBelowNoiseFloor(recentAudio, settings: settings) {
                consecutiveSilentChecks += 1
            } else {
                consecutiveSilentChecks = 0
            }
        }

        // Safety: max 60 seconds
        if capturedAudio.count > Int(ProcessingSettings.sampleRate * 60) * inputChannelCount {
            throw AudioProcessingError.processingFailed("Reverb mode exceeded 60 second maximum")
        }
    }
} else {
    // Fixed length mode
    while capturedAudio.count < targetRecordingSamples {
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 10_000_000)
    }
}
```

**Lines 686-719** (Helper Method):
```swift
private func isReverbTailBelowNoiseFloor(_ audioWindow: [Float],
                                          settings: ProcessingSettings) -> Bool {
    guard let noiseFloorDb = settings.measuredNoiseFloorDb else {
        // Fallback: -80 dB threshold
        let fallbackThreshold: Float = 0.0001
        let maxAbsSample = audioWindow.map { abs($0) }.max() ?? 0
        return maxAbsSample < fallbackThreshold
    }

    // Calculate threshold with margin
    let thresholdDb = noiseFloorDb + (noiseFloorDb * settings.noiseFloorMarginPercent / 100.0)

    // Find peak in window
    let maxAbsSample = audioWindow.map { abs($0) }.max() ?? 0
    let maxDb = maxAbsSample > 0 ? 20.0 * log10(maxAbsSample) : -160.0

    // Check if below threshold
    let isBelowThreshold = maxDb < thresholdDb

    if isBelowThreshold {
        print("Reverb tail detected: \(maxDb) dB < threshold \(thresholdDb) dB")
    }

    return isBelowThreshold
}
```

### [SettingsView.swift](F9-Batch-Resampler/Views/SettingsView.swift)

**Lines 171-213** (Reverb Mode Toggle):
```swift
Toggle("Reverb Mode (stop on noise floor)", isOn: Binding(
    get: { vm.settings.useReverbMode },
    set: { newValue in
        vm.settings.useReverbMode = newValue
        // Auto-measure when enabling
        if newValue && vm.settings.measuredNoiseFloorDb == nil {
            Task {
                await vm.measureLatency()
            }
        }
    }
))

if vm.settings.useReverbMode {
    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 4) {
        // Margin slider
        HStack {
            Text("Noise floor margin:")
            Spacer()
            Text("\(String(format: "%.0f", vm.settings.noiseFloorMarginPercent))%")

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Plate Reverb on Snare

**Setup**:
- Source: snare_01.wav (100ms dry hit)
- Hardware: Plate reverb with 3.5 second tail
- Noise floor: -96 dB
- Margin: 10%

**Fixed Length Mode**:
```
Recording time = 100ms + 11ms (latency) + 44ms (safety)
                = 155ms
Result: Only captures 155ms, cuts off reverb tail!
```

**Reverb Mode**:
```
Minimum = 100ms + 11ms = 111ms
Monitors tail...
Reverb decays: -20dB → -40dB → -60dB → -80dB → -100dB → -105.6dB ✓
Stops after 300ms silence detected
Total recording = 3,611ms
Result: Captures full 3.5 second reverb tail perfectly!
```

### Example 2: Drum Sample with No Reverb

**Setup**:
- Source: kick_01.wav (80ms)
- Hardware: 1176 compressor (no reverb)
- Noise floor: -94 dB

**Fixed Length Mode**:
```
Recording = 80ms + 11ms + 44ms = 135ms
Fast and predictable
```

**Reverb Mode**:
```
Minimum = 80ms + 11ms = 91ms
Checks for tail...
Silence detected immediately (no reverb)
Stops after 300ms = 391ms total
Result: Slightly longer but still captures cleanly
```

**Recommendation**: Use fixed length for dry samples, reverb mode for wet samples.

### Example 3: Cathedral Reverb (Long Tail)

**Setup**:
- Source: vocal_phrase.wav (2 seconds)
- Hardware: Cathedral reverb with 8 second tail
- Noise floor: -98 dB
- Margin: 15%

**Reverb Mode**:
```
Minimum = 2,000ms + 11ms = 2,011ms
Monitors tail...
8 second reverb decay captured
Threshold = -98 + (-98 × 0.15) = -112.7 dB
Tail falls below -112.7 dB at 10.3 seconds
Total recording = 10,300ms
Result: Captures entire cathedral reverb tail!
```

## Performance Considerations

### CPU Usage
- **Standard Mode**: 1 check every 10ms (wait for target length)
- **Reverb Mode**: 1 check every 50ms + peak detection on 100ms window
- **Impact**: Negligible - peak detection is very fast

### Memory Usage
- **Standard Mode**: Allocates fixed buffer size
- **Reverb Mode**: Buffer grows until tail detected
- **Savings**: Can save memory on short tails
- **Cost**: Uses more memory on long tails (but captures what you need!)

### Time Efficiency

**Short Reverb (< 1 second)**:
- Fixed mode slightly faster (no tail detection overhead)
- Difference: ~300ms

**Medium Reverb (1-3 seconds)**:
- Reverb mode starts winning
- Saves time by not recording empty safety buffer

**Long Reverb (> 3 seconds)**:
- Reverb mode much more efficient
- Fixed mode would need huge safety buffer or risk truncation

## Troubleshooting

### Reverb Mode Stops Too Early

**Symptoms**: Reverb tail gets cut off

**Causes**:
1. Margin too low (threshold too strict)
2. Noise floor measurement inaccurate
3. Room noise interfering

**Solutions**:
```
1. Increase noise floor margin: 10% → 20% → 30%
2. Re-measure noise floor in quieter environment
3. Check hardware loop cable quality
```

### Reverb Mode Never Stops

**Symptoms**: Recording hits 60 second limit

**Causes**:
1. Constant noise in signal path
2. Noise floor measurement too low
3. Hardware adding noise

**Solutions**:
```
1. Check for ground loops or cable issues
2. Re-measure noise floor
3. Increase margin to be more tolerant
4. Switch to fixed length mode for this file
```

### Noise Floor Not Measured

**Symptoms**: Warning shown in UI

**What Happens**:
- Reverb mode uses -80 dB fallback threshold
- Less accurate than measured noise floor
- May stop too early or too late

**Solution**:
```
1. Connect hardware loop cable
2. Click "Measure Latency" in Settings
3. Or enable reverb mode (auto-measures)
4. Or start processing (auto-measures if needed)
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Reverb Mode

✅ **Use reverb mode when**:
- Processing samples through hardware reverb
- Capturing long delay tails
- Working with plate/spring/chamber reverbs
- Unknown reverb tail length
- Want to capture full natural decay

❌ **Use fixed length when**:
- Dry samples (no reverb/delay)
- Short compressor/EQ processing
- Batch processing large libraries quickly
- Reverb tail length is known and short

### Margin Settings

**Conservative (5-10%)**:
- Very accurate to measured noise floor
- May stop slightly early on long, quiet tails
- Best for: Short to medium reverbs

**Balanced (10-20%)** - Default:
- Good compromise
- Rarely cuts off tails prematurely
- Works for most reverb types

**Aggressive (30-50%)**:
- Very tolerant of noise
- Ensures full tail capture
- May record slightly more silence
- Best for: Noisy environments, long cathedral reverbs

### Workflow Tips

1. **Measure Once**: Noise floor stable for a session
2. **Test First**: Process one file to verify tail capture
3. **Batch Similar**: Group files by reverb type
4. **Monitor Log**: Watch console for "Reverb tail detected" messages
5. **Adjust Margin**: If tails cut off, increase margin
