# Latency Compensation & Trimming Implementation

## Date: 2025-10-19

---

## Overview

Implemented automatic latency compensation for hardware loopback recording. The system now:
1. ✅ Records for the correct duration (source length + latency + safety buffer)
2. ✅ Automatically trims measured latency from the beginning of captured audio
3. ✅ Outputs files matching the source file length

---

## How It Works

### The Problem

When recording audio through hardware (e.g., RME interface), there's a round-trip delay:
```
Computer → DAC → Analog Out → Loopback Cable → Analog In → ADC → Computer
```

This introduces **latency** (typically hundreds of samples at 44.1kHz).

**Without compensation**:
- A 1-second kick drum plays starting at 0.00s
- It gets recorded starting at 0.012s (example: 512 samples of latency)
- The output file is misaligned by 12ms

**With compensation**:
- System measures latency: 512 samples
- Records extra 512 samples at the beginning
- Trims the first 512 samples from captured audio
- Output file is perfectly aligned

## Implementation Details

### 1. Extended Recording Length

**File**: [AudioProcessingService.swift](F9-Batch-Resampler/Services/AudioProcessingService.swift)

#### Calculation (Lines 172-174 and 312-315):

```swift
// Get measured latency (required for processing)
guard let measuredLatencySamples = settings.measuredLatencySamples else {
    throw AudioProcessingError.processingFailed("Latency not measured - please measure latency first")
}

// Calculate target recording length: source + latency + safety buffer
let inputChannelCount = inputPair.channels.count
let targetRecordingFrames = settings.recordingLength(sourceFileSamples: frameCount,
                                                     latencySamples: measuredLatencySamples)
let targetRecordingSamples = targetRecordingFrames * inputChannelCount
```

#### Recording Length Formula:

From [ProcessingSettings.swift:63-65](F9-Batch-Resampler/Models/ProcessingSettings.swift#L63-L65):

```swift
func recordingLength(sourceFileSamples: Int, latencySamples: Int) -> Int {
    return sourceFileSamples + latencySamples + (latencySamples * 4)
}
```

**Breakdown**:
- `sourceFileSamples` - Original file length (e.g., 44,100 samples = 1 second @ 44.1kHz)
- `+ latencySamples` - Hardware round-trip delay (e.g., 512 samples)
- `+ (latencySamples * 4)` - Safety buffer (4x latency to ensure we capture everything)

**Example** (44.1kHz, 512 samples latency):
- Source: 44,100 samples (1.0 second)
- Latency: 512 samples (~11.6ms)
- Safety: 2,048 samples (~46ms)
- **Total Recording**: 46,660 samples (~1.057 seconds)

### 2. Wait for Complete Capture

**Before** (Lines 210-212 - OLD):
```swift
// Wait for processing to complete
while currentFrame < totalFrames {
    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 10_000_000) // 10ms
}
```
❌ **Problem**: Only waited for playback to finish, not for capture to complete

**After** (Lines 220-227 - NEW):
```swift
// Wait until we've captured enough samples (source length + latency + buffer)
while capturedAudio.count < targetRecordingSamples {
    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 10_000_000) // 10ms

    // Safety check: if we've captured way more than expected, something is wrong
    if capturedAudio.count > targetRecordingSamples * 2 {
        throw AudioProcessingError.processingFailed("Recording exceeded expected length")
    }
}
```
✅ **Solution**: Waits until we've captured the full required length

---

### 3. Trim Latency from Beginning

**New Method** (Lines 558-587):

```swift
/// Trim latency samples from the beginning of captured audio
private func trimLatency(from capturedAudio: [Float],
                         latencySamples: Int,
                         sourceFrames: Int,
                         channelCount: Int) -> [Float] {
    // Calculate where to start and how much to extract
    let startSample = latencySamples
    let desiredOutputSamples = sourceFrames * channelCount

    // Safety bounds checking
    guard startSample < capturedAudio.count else {
        print("Warning: Not enough captured audio to trim latency")
        return Array(capturedAudio.prefix(desiredOutputSamples))
    }

    let endSample = min(startSample + desiredOutputSamples, capturedAudio.count)
    let trimmedAudio = Array(capturedAudio[startSample..<endSample])

    // Log trimming info for debugging
    print("Trim: Captured \(capturedAudio.count) samples, trimmed \(latencySamples) samples, output \(trimmedAudio.count) samples")

    return trimmedAudio
}
```

**What it does**:
1. Skips the first `latencySamples` samples (the hardware delay)
2. Extracts exactly `sourceFrames * channelCount` samples
3. Returns audio aligned to the original playback start time

**Visual Example**:
```
Captured Audio:
[Latency: 512 samples] [Actual Signal: 44,100 samples] [Safety Buffer: 2,048]
│←──── skip ────→│←──── extract this ────→│←─ ignore ─→│

Trimmed Audio:
[Actual Signal: 44,100 samples]  ← Perfect alignment!
```

### 4. Updated Output Writing

**Lines 238-243 and 379-384**:

```swift
// Trim latency from the beginning of captured audio
let latencySamples = measuredLatencySamples * inputChannelCount
let trimmedAudio = trimLatency(from: capturedAudio,
                               latencySamples: latencySamples,
                               sourceFrames: frameCount,
                               channelCount: inputChannelCount)
```

**Lines 274-291 (processFile) and 415-432 (processFileWithInitializedSystem)**:

```swift
// Convert trimmed data to non-interleaved for writing
let trimmedFrameCount = trimmedAudio.count / inputChannelCount
let outputBuffer = AVAudioPCMBuffer(pcmFormat: outputFormat,
                                   frameCapacity: AVAudioFrameCount(trimmedFrameCount))!
outputBuffer.frameLength = AVAudioFrameCount(trimmedFrameCount)

// Convert interleaved trimmed audio to non-interleaved buffer format
for frame in 0..<trimmedFrameCount {
    for channel in 0..<inputChannelCount {
        let sourceIndex = frame * inputChannelCount + channel
        if sourceIndex < trimmedAudio.count {
            outputChannelData[channel][frame] = trimmedAudio[sourceIndex]
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Change**: Uses `trimmedAudio` instead of `capturedAudio` for output

## Workflow

### Complete Processing Flow:

```
1. User measures latency
   └─> MainViewModel.measureLatency()
       └─> settings.measuredLatencySamples = 512 (example)

2. User processes files
   └─> MainViewModel.processAllFiles()
       └─> AudioProcessingService.processFiles([files])
           │
           ├─> For each file:
           │   ├─> Load source audio (44,100 frames)
           │   ├─> Calculate recording target: 44,100 + 512 + 2,048 = 46,660 samples
           │   ├─> Start playback + capture
           │   ├─> Wait until captured >= 46,660 samples
           │   ├─> Stop audio
           │   ├─> Trim first 512 samples (latency)
           │   ├─> Extract next 44,100 samples (source length)
           │   └─> Write to output file (44,100 samples - perfect!)
           │
           └─> 150ms delay between files

3. Output files are perfectly aligned
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Latency Measured**: Ensure latency is measured before processing
- [ ] **Single File**: Test processing a single kick drum sample
- [ ] **Batch Files**: Test with multiple samples (10+)
- [ ] **Verify Length**: Output files should match source length exactly
- [ ] **Verify Alignment**: Check that transients align with source
- [ ] **Different Latencies**: Test with different buffer sizes (128, 256, 512, 1024)
- [ ] **Edge Cases**:
  - [ ] Very short files (< 1 second)
  - [ ] Very long files (> 10 seconds)
  - [ ] Files shorter than latency value (should error gracefully)

---

## Debug Information

### Console Logging

The `trimLatency()` method prints debug info:

```
Trim: Captured 46660 samples, trimmed 1024 samples, output 44100 samples (expected 44100)
```

**What to look for**:
- `Captured` should be ≈ `sourceLength + latency + (latency * 4)`
- `trimmed` should equal `measuredLatencySamples * channelCount`
- `output` should equal `sourceLength * channelCount`
- `output == expected` confirms correct trimming

### Error Messages

If latency isn't measured:
```
❌ Failed: Latency not measured - please measure latency first
```

If recording exceeds expected length:
```
❌ Failed: Recording exceeded expected length
```

If not enough captured audio:
```
Warning: Not enough captured audio to trim latency. Expected at least X samples, got Y
```

## Future Enhancements (Stubbed)

### Reverb Mode

**Status**: Stubbed for now (will implement later)

**Goal**: Instead of fixed-length recording, continue until signal drops below noise floor

**Settings**:
- `useReverbMode: Bool` - Enable/disable
- `measuredNoiseFloorDb: Float?` - Measured noise floor
- `noiseFloorMarginPercent: Float` - How much above noise floor to continue

**Implementation Plan**:
```swift
if settings.useReverbMode {
    // Continue capturing until signal < noiseFloorThreshold
    let threshold = settings.noiseFloorThresholdDb
    while !isBelowNoiseFloor(capturedAudio, threshold) {
        // Keep recording...
    }
} else {
    // Fixed-length recording (current implementation)
    while capturedAudio.count < targetRecordingSamples { ... }
}
```

**Use Case**: Capturing reverb tails, long decays, or ambience

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Requires Latency Measurement**: Processing will fail if latency hasn't been measured
   - Solution: UI prevents processing until measurement is done

2. **Fixed Sample Rate**: Currently hardcoded to 44.1kHz
   - Future: Support multiple sample rates

3. **No Reverb Mode Yet**: Captures fixed length only
   - Future: Implement noise floor detection

4. **Safety Buffer**: 4x latency might be overkill for some hardware
   - Configurable in `ProcessingSettings.recordingLength()`

---

## Mathematical Verification

### Example Calculation:

**Given**:
- Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz
- Source Length: 1.0 second = 44,100 samples
- Measured Latency: 512 samples (~11.6ms)
- Channels: 2 (stereo input)

**Recording Length**:
```
Frames = sourceFrames + latency + (latency * 4)
       = 44,100 + 512 + 2,048
       = 46,660 frames

Samples = frames * channels
        = 46,660 * 2
        = 93,320 samples
```

**Trimming**:
```
Skip = latency * channels
     = 512 * 2
     = 1,024 samples

Extract = sourceFrames * channels
        = 44,100 * 2
        = 88,200 samples

Output = capturedAudio[1,024 ... 89,224]
       = 88,200 samples
       = 44,100 frames
       = 1.0 second ✓
```
